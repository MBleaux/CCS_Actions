1. Introduction
==========================================
Installation:
InstaCal is an easy to use installation, calibration and test utility 
for your data acquisition hardware. When you plug in your Measurement
Computing Hardware, InstaCal detects the hardware and assigns resources 
automatically. You may set special features of the hardware so your software 
programs will run as you wish. All the settings are stored in the 
Measurement Computing configuration file.

Calibration:
Once your board is installed, you may want to check calibration. 
InstaCal walks you through a professional calibration procedure tailored 
to the board you own.

Test:
InstaCal will test the board both internally and externally, giving you 
complete confidence in the board operation. If a problem is found, 
it is clearly identified which will speed a complete repair.
